            <p class="aboutme"> I live in the state of NJ in the Jersey City. Currently employed in at Chick-Fil-A
                Newport Mall. I work the back so I'm either cooking the meat, making the sandwiches, or in the farther
                back cleaning the dishes.
                Sometimes it can go well when the rush isn't too heavy. Sometimes we even get rewarded with free shakes
                for the excellent hard work
                we did during the rush. I personally feel like it can be too much at times, but thats how any job is
                gonna be. Hence why i always aim for the sky!
            </p>

            <p class="aboutme"> I'm also a gamer. Mainly play consules such as my Xbox One, Switch, and PS4.
                However I have been playing more and more of my laptop related games such as Minecraft, BTD6 (Ballon
                Tower Defence 6),
                Last Year, and Ark Survival Evolve. Ark being my favorite due to the many mods I get to use along with
                it. I play most of my PC/Laptop games via steam.
                So feel free to contact me if you wish to add me.
            </p>

            <p class="aboutme">I'm also a small youtuber that is interested in going live on either twitch and/or mixer.
                YT being Arc Tsuki and on Twitch Arc_Tsuki_Lycan. Mixer still being in the works. </p>

            <p class="aboutme">Some of my other hobbies besides gaming is to cook and to create things out of other
                spare parts.
                Even if it may seem dumb to others. It helps express my creative mind at times but to also help me pass
                time when ever I feel as tho I have to much of it if playing Yu-Gi-Oh doesnt help.
            </p>

            <p class="aboutme"> Also no I don't need glasses they just naturally look nice on some poeple.</p>
